# Morse Code Translator

This was created as part of a UBC Orbit Command and Data Handling subsystem assignment. A phrase composed of capital letters and/or Arabic numerals is acquired from a UART module of user-specified size (up to 9 characters). Then, the Morse Code equivalent of the phrase is output onto the STM-32 Dev Board Green LED (GPIOA Pin 5). The file in which this is implemented is src/startup/main.cpp. The repo is cloned from UBC Orbit to work with the STM-32 Microcontroller in preparation for future work on Trillium subsystem. Credit should be provided to UBC Orbit and Sam Schweigel of Command and Data Handling for assistance in implementing the UART and debugging the code,involving pointers and STM library functions.
